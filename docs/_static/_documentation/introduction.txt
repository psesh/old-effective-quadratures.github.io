Effective Quadratures
*************************

Effective Quadratures is an open-source library for *uncertainty quantification*, *machine learning*, *optimisation*, *numerical integration* and *dimension reduction* -- all using orthogonal polynomials. It is particularly useful for models / problems where output quantities of interest are smooth and continuous; to this extent it has found widespread applications in computational engineering models (finite elements, computational fluid dynamics, etc). It is built on the latest research within these areas and has both deterministic and randomized algorithms. Effective Quadratures is actively being developed by researchers at the `University of Cambridge <https://www.cam.ac.uk>`__ , `Stanford University <https://www.stanford.edu>`__, `The University of Utah <https://www.utah.edu>`__, `The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk>`__ and the `University of Cagliari <https://www.unica.it/unica/>`__.

**Key words associated with this code**: polynomial surrogates, polynomial chaos, polynomial variable projection, Gaussian quadrature, Clenshaw Curtis, polynomial least squares, compressed sensing, gradient-enhanced surrogates, supervised learning.

Workshops
***********

We routinely organize workshops covering the theory, algorithms and applications of Effective Quadratures. Some of the salient topics include:

* probability distributions and orthogonal polynomials
* supervised machine learning: regression and compressive sensing
* numerical quadrature and high-dimensional sampling
* transforms for correlated parameters
* computing moments from models and data-sets
* sensitivity analysis and Sobol' indices
* data-driven dimension reduction
* ridge approximations and neural networks
* surrogate-based design optimisation

If this is of interest, please do get in touch. Upcoming workshops include:

- 23rd August 2019, Rolls-Royce, Derbyshire.
- 16th September 2019, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, Oxfordshire.
