Modules
==================
This page covers some of the key modules in Effective Quadratures; they are split into two parts. First we have the **core building blocks** to assist users in creating bespoke polynomial approximations for their data. 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   
   parameter
   basis
   poly

Then we have the **polynomial exploiting utilities** that leverage a polynomial approximation to facilitate specific user centric tasks. These include finding dimension reducing subspaces, optimisation with polynomial surrogates, polynomial based deep learning and generating correlated sample sets.
