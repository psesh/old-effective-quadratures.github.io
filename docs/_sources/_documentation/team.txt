About us
*************************

Our goal in developing Effective Quadratures has always been underscored by an ethos of inclusivity and respect. We understand the responsibility that comes with open-source code and its power; we want to help spread the capability of our tools, their underlying research, and make them available for all. When first developed, this code was tailored to replicate results found in leading papers within the field of uncertainty quantification using polynomial approximations. The community at the time did not have a single code that could be used to benchmark new sampling strategies and coefficient computation methodologies. Its utility has since grown well-beyond uncertainty quantification and now can be used in optimisation, dimension reduction and machine learning. Moving forward our hope is that this code will continue to be useful to students, researchers and industry.
